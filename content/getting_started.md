## Quick start with Nerves Livebook firmware

The Nerves Livebook firmware lets you try out the Nerves projects on real hardware without needing to build anything. Within minutes, you'll have a Raspberry Pi or Beaglebone running Nerves. You'll be able to run code in Livebook and work through Nerves tutorials from the comfort of your browser.
